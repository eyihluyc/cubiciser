# cubiciser
Cubic collage maker by an evolutionary algorithm. Created for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at Innopolis University.

In [technical report](../technical_report.pdf), I explain the algorithm and show results.

In order to use this code, download it, place input images (maybe depicting the same object from different viewpoints?) in the `images` folder, and run `assemblage.py`. Retrieve output in the `results` folder.

Should any problem occur, please [contact me](https://t.me/feuer_fox).
